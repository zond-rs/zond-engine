//! # Network Interfaces
//!
//! This module resolves, validates, and routes the network hardware interfaces attached
//! to the host. It provides capabilities like classifying local hardware
//! connections (wired vs wireless), fetching network IPv4 assignments,
//! and routing an arbitrary set of network targets securely out of the host boundaries.
//!
//! Exposes a clean facade for all interface management logic to consumers.
